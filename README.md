## âœ… Key Insights
- Students who completed the **test preparation course** scored significantly higher.
- There is a slight advantage in math scores for **male students**.
- **Higher parental education level** is positively correlated with better student performance.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle: Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells in order.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
- Build predictive models to classify student performance.
- Analyze reading and writing scores in addition to math.
- Create an interactive dashboard using **Plotly** or **Streamlit**.
