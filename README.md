# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes student performance in Math using data from Kaggle.  
The goal is to explore how different factors affect academic performance, such as:
- Gender
- Test preparation course
- Parental level of education

The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and key insights.

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Students who completed the **test preparation course** scored significantly higher.
- There is a slight advantage in math scores for **male students**.
- **Higher parental education level** is positively correlated with better student performance.

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle: Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells in order.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Build predictive models to classify student performance.
- Analyze reading and writing scores in addition to math.
- Create an interactive dashboard using **Plotly** or **Streamlit**.
